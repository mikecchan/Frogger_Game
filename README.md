# Classic Arcade Game Clone

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity for me to practice my object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences my application architecture and provides performance optimization.

I will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I will add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

I will learn JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. I will discover a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.

## How to Play

In this game you have a Player (you) and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Use the arrow keys to move the player.
